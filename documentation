ELK/EFK Architecutre
----------------------
Elastic Search, Log stash, kibana
Elastic Search, file beat, kibana

recommended for elastic search is 'C series" instance type

server1----------Beats-------shipsTo----Elastic-----visualize the data----kibana
                                         ^

why do we use logs:
-------------------
to reduce the time
suppose if we have 100 ec2's and we get some issue we don't know which one is giving the issue, we can't login each ec2 and check it consumes lot of time so,inorder to overcome that we use logging 


logs:
access_log
error_log

/var/log/httpd/ -- for apache

log rotation:*** logs keep changing based on time and file size
--------------
1.time based
2.size based

access_log.month.date.hours.min.secs---- time based
access_log.month.date.hours.min.secs.size --size based

kibana does indexing

rpm--radhat package manager

df -h --> to check storage usage

how to check which folder is consuming more storage in place---> du -sh *|sort -n

to check memory usage -- free -m

to nullify any file: >

to make symlink:
-----------------
if you make a symlink, if you upgrade the version we can link the new download file & we can use it 
*****
always take backup of the file when you are gonna modify it

to changer ownership ----chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user...


127.0.0.1:9300
port 9300 is binded to 120.0.0.1
it will work on only in this ip address


when you execute the shell script with filename.sh if you get permission denied
check the owner and permission(it should have read, write &execute) without doing all this
you can run as sh filename.sh


to make alias
----------------
alias kibana ="path/fileName.sh" -- this is temparory

to make permanent alias:
----------------------
your home diretory
.bashrc
at the end before unset
after edit runsource.basgrc

check user specific command---ex: which kibana

watch -n 

steps:
-------
filebeat

filebeat.yaml:
---------------
provide ES url
provide logs path
provide index

to debug shell script:
---------------------
sh -x file.sh
